From Wiki, "Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites"

It is quite challenging, instead of getting datasets and building a ML model on top of it, 
one can scrape a website and take the data which he/she wants to work on. 
Most of the companies will provide API's to extract the data from their website. 
Not all the data that can be scrapped, a few restrictions though.


Important notes about web scraping:
1.Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. 
2.Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
3.Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. 
4.You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.
